# SustainabilityCoach
This is the CS102 project of the Saviours of the Green World

Sustainability coach is a program aiming to the users keep track of their sustainable habits by enabling them to record achievements given by the program. Our program has a website-like interface which requires signing up and signing in for further actions. After the login, the player will record the things they have done on the achievements page. On the news page, we can see the highest-ranking players. In the profile section, the player can update and maintain their information. We have shrunk some features of our planned program as we have lost some team members along the way.
