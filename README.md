Importnant notice from Project Specification Document for CS102 on Moodle : 

We also expect you to use Github Wiki pages so that you can manage your project and keep
track of progress. Please read this first, then head on over to the wiki and update your
group's "First Page" (adding the title, group name, names of groups members, etc).
Remember to keep logs of your Group meetings there too, and, most importantly, create and
maintain your Personal Log page. Don't forget, keeping a record of what you personally do
each week is a minimum course requirement
